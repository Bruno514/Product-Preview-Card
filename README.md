## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS Preprocessor
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - For styles
- [Vite](https://vite.dev) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling

### What I learned

Learned some about CSS Modules and flexbox, in particulaly, learned on how to make items stay the sime size on a flex container.

```css
.container {
  display: flexbox;
}

.child {
  flex: 1 0 50%; /* Only works for a "2 item" container */
}
```

Still don't like my HTML semantics and I'm looking to improve it.

### Continued development

Responsiveness feels good, I should probably leave at this state. Perfectionism sucks.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://web.dev/learn/design/responsive-images) - Learned a lot about responsiveness on images.

- [Example resource 2](https://web.dev/learn/design/typography) - Another GREAT resource.
